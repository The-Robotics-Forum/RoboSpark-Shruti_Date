        <h1>Smart street : Automated street light and signal bumpers.</h1>
        <p>I.  INTRODUCTION :<br>
            This paper shows the design to detect the vehicle movement on roadways to switch ON just a block of road lights in front of it,<br>
            and to turn OFF the trailing lights to save energy. During night each one of the lights on the expressway stay ON for the vehicles,<br>
            yet loss of power is experienced when there is no vehicle movement. This proposed framework satisfactorily works for energy saving.<br>
            This is accomplished by detecting a vehicle moving towards the street and turns ON a block of street lamps in front of the vehicle.<br>
            As the vehicle moves forward by, the trailing lamps turn OFF on its own.
            And the other part of paper is based on problems related to the traffic and  traffic signal system .<br>
            Because of the violation of traffic signals and traffic rules in there are so many  major accidents held in the whole world. <br>
            To avoid such a problems we have to develop a new system effectively. In this project we have made a smart traffic signal system .<br>
            Which can work effectively with the  help of motors. In these signal system  as soon as the red light blinks the spike pop up on the road <br>
            and vehicles are not able to voilet the traffic signal. And then when the green signal blinks the spikes goes inside the ground and people can go forward.<br>
            With the help of these system we are able to control the traffic and maintain the traffic efficiently.
